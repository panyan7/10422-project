# Zeroth-Order Online Convex Optimization
This is my project for CMU's **10-422 Foundations of Learning, Game Theory, and Their Connections** by Nina Balcan in Spring 2023. It is about zeroth order online convex optimization, and includes my [slides](https://github.com/panyan7/10422-project/blob/main/slide.pdf) and [final report](https://github.com/panyan7/10422-project/blob/main/writeup.pdf).
